<h1>Hello world</h1>
<p>I am a Berlin-based office manager who likes the web, post-post-modern aesthetics, getting around on my bike, photography, and music.

I am quite good at building workspace conditions, processes, and landing new people in their role. Specially for growing teams. Need me to make sure everybody is cozy in their productive environment? Boom, you got it! I am Pretty much a master of the outernetðŸ˜Ž, or Jack of all trades if you will.</p>
<p>I am currently teaching myself to code and use Github, hence why I made this website with Bootstrap, Grayscale, a gif from Giphy.com and some of my own little hacks in the code (Including hosting it with Dropbox, hehe).</p>

<p>Special thanks to the Berlin Geekettes, General Assembly, and Tony Blank for inspiring me to do this.</p>
